# BITS Attendance Policy Protest Website

A student-led movement website protesting the implementation of 50% mandatory attendance policy at BITS Pilani.

## 🚨 The Issue

BITS Pilani administration is implementing a mandatory 50% attendance requirement for the 2025 batch, breaking 60+ years of academic freedom tradition.

## 🎯 Key Points

- **Ex-IIT Leadership**: Current VC (ex-IIT Delhi Director) and Hyderabad Director (ex-IIT Bombay Professor) are destroying BITS culture
- **Fee Hypocrisy**: IITs charge ₹10L for 4 years, BITS charges ₹30L for 4 years
- **Non-Profit Scam**: BITS is legally non-profit but charges premium fees
- **Taking Worst Aspects**: Copying IIT restrictions while charging 3x more
